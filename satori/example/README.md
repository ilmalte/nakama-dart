# Satori Flutter Example

This is a Flutter example application demonstrating the usage of the Satori SDK for Dart/Flutter.

## What is Satori?

Satori is a liveops server for games that provides:

- **Feature Flags**: Control features in your app remotely
- **Live Events**: Real-time events and campaigns
- **A/B Testing Experiments**: Run controlled experiments to test features
- **Event Tracking**: Track custom events for analytics

## Features Demonstrated

This example app demonstrates the following Satori features:

### 1. Authentication
- Authenticate users with custom identities
- Session management

### 2. Events
- Send custom events to Satori
- Track user interactions and game events

### 3. Feature Flags
- Retrieve and display feature flags
- Control app behavior remotely

### 4. Experiments
- Load A/B testing experiments
- Display experiment variations

### 5. Live Events
- Fetch active live events
- Display event details and timing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Flutter SDK installed
2. A Satori server running (or access to a Satori cloud instance)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the example directory:
   ```bash
   cd satori/example
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Configure your Satori server settings in `lib/configs/config.dev.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "SATORI_BASE_URL": "your-satori-host",
       "SATORI_PORT": "7350",
       "SATORI_SSL": "false",
       "SATORI_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
   }
   ```
5. Run the app with configuration:
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define-from-file=lib/configs/config.dev.json
   ```
   
   **Or in VS Code**: Use the "satori_example (dev config)" launch configuration which is already set up to load the environment variables.

### Configuration

The app uses environment variables loaded from `lib/configs/config.dev.json`. Update this file with your Satori server settings:

```json
{
    "SATORI_BASE_URL": "your-satori-host",
    "SATORI_PORT": "7350",
    "SATORI_SSL": "false",
    "SATORI_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `SATORI_BASE_URL`: Your Satori server host
- `SATORI_PORT`: Server port (usually 443 for SSL, 7350 for non-SSL)
- `SATORI_SSL`: Whether to use SSL connection ("true" or "false")
- `SATORI_API_KEY`: Your Satori API key
}
```

## Usage

1. **Start the app** and authenticate with a custom identity
2. **Navigate through features** using the home screen grid
3. **Send events** to track user interactions
4. **View feature flags** to see remote configuration
5. **Check experiments** for A/B testing variations
6. **Browse live events** for active campaigns
